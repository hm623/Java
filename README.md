Java Projects for Java Data Structures

Key Projects:

1. ******** Card Game - Terminal Edition 🎴*****************
A console-based card game where a player competes against the computer, featuring text-based graphics, ANSI color formatting, and sound effects. The game is played entirely in the terminal, with dynamic visuals and an interactive user experience.

Features
✅ Card-Based Gameplay – Play against the computer with a structured deck system.
✅ Text-Based Graphics – Uses ASCII characters to visually represent cards.
✅ ANSI Color Formatting – Styled output for a visually engaging experience.
✅ Interactive Controls – Custom cursor movement and screen clearing.
✅ Audio Support – In-game sound effects powered by Java’s sound library.

How to Play
Run the game in the terminal using Java.
Make moves by selecting cards or interacting with the game’s interface.
The computer plays against you, and the game follows predefined rules.
Visual elements and card displays update dynamically using ANSI colors.


2. ************ Markov Text Generator 📜****************
A Markov-based text generator that learns from an input text and produces realistic sequences of words using probabilistic modeling. This program uses Markov chains to predict the next word based on previous words, generating coherent text outputs.

Features
✅ Markov Chain Implementation – Uses a Hashtable-based approach to store and predict word sequences.
✅ Customizable Order – Supports variable-length Markov chains to improve output coherence.
✅ Text-Based Training – Reads from a text file and learns the frequency of word sequences.
✅ Randomized Output – Generates unique text each time based on probability distributions.
✅ Efficient Processing – Uses vectors and hashmaps for fast word lookup and selection.

How It Works
The program reads input text and builds a Markov chain by storing word sequences in a Hashtable or HashMap.
Each word is linked to possible next words, creating a probability-based word transition model.
The program randomly selects words based on learned probabilities, generating a new text sequence.


3. ******** Maze Solver 🏁*********
A Java-based maze solver that navigates through a grid using stack-based backtracking. This project provides an efficient way to find paths through mazes using recursive depth-first search (DFS) or similar algorithms.

Features
✅ Maze Representation – The maze is structured using a grid system with coordinate-based navigation.
✅ Backtracking Algorithm – Uses a stack-based approach to find a valid path through the maze.
✅ Point-Based System – Each position in the maze is stored as a Point(x, y, color).
✅ Modular Structure – Can be extended to support different maze-solving techniques.

How It Works
The maze is represented as a grid where each position is a Point object.
The solver attempts to move through the maze using DFS and backtracking to find an exit.
It keeps track of visited points and updates the solution dynamically.
The algorithm stops when the exit is reached or when no path is available.
